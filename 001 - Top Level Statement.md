# Top-level statements

namespace -> classes -> members -> method -> statements<br>
.NET 6.0 use C# 10 by default. With C# 10, you donâ€™t necessarily need to include using System; or define a class and Main method for very simple programs, thanks to top-level statements. You can write a minimal program like this:
```
  Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```
This works because C# 10 allows you to omit the traditional structure, making it easier to write quick scripts or small applications.<br>

However, if you're working on a larger project or prefer the traditional structure for readability and organization, you can still use the full syntax:<br>
Traditional C#<br>
The Auto-generate code does not  define a namespace, so the "ConsoleApp" class is implicitly defined in an empty namespace with no name instead of a namespace that matches the name of the project.<br>
Top-level programs include:
<ul>
  <li>There can be onlyu one file like this in a project</li>
  <li>Any "using" statements must be at the top of the file.</li>
  <li>Declare any classes or other types must be at the bottom of the file</li>
  <li>Should name "Main" method if explicitly define</li>
</ul>
"using System" is import globally in consoleApp/object/Debug/net9.0/ConsoleApp.GlobalUsing.g.cs

```
//using System;
//namespace ???? {
  class ConsoleApp
  {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
//}
```
ConsoleApp.GlobalUsing.g.cs
```
// <auto-generated/>
global using global::System;
global using global::System.Collections.Generic;
global using global::System.IO;
global using global::System.Linq;
global using global::System.Net.Http;
global using global::System.Threading;
global using global::System.Threading.Tasks;
```

Both approaches are valid, so you can choose based on your preference and the context of your project!
